Week 1 JavaScript Practice ‚Äî ‚ÄúLibrary Book Manager‚Äù

Scenario:
You are making a small program to manage a list of books in a library.
Your goal is to use every concept from the lesson.

Steps to Complete:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating arrays

Array literal:

Create an array books containing at least 4 book titles.

Spread operator:

Create another array moreBooks that includes all books from books plus 2 new ones.

Array() constructor:

Create an array emptyShelves with 3 empty slots.

Array.of():

Create an array ratings with the numbers 5, 4, 3, 5.

Array.from():

Create an array titleLengths from the books array, where each element is the length of that title.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reading and writing elements

Print the first book in books.

Change the second book title to "Harry Potter".

Use a variable i = 2 to change the third book title.

Add a new book to the end of the array.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding and deleting elements

Add one book to the start of books.

Remove the last book from books.

Remove the first book from books.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Destructuring assignment

Use array destructuring to store the first two books from books into variables firstBook and secondBook.

Print them.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Iterating arrays

Iterate through books and print index + title in this format:

0: The Hobbit
1: Harry Potter


Do the same but also print "Length: X" for each title.

üí° Bonus Challenge:

Combine books and ratings into one array of objects:

{ title: "The Hobbit", rating: 5 }


Then sort by rating (highest first) and print them.
